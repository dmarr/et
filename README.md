Fork [this|https://github.com/dmarr/et] repo and share jsfiddle-ready demos.

Using the method described here: http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/github_read.html

I am creating this due to some security updates in chrome that prevented loading
of text/plain MIME types for execution which prevented me from linking to github
repos via the Resources feature of jsfiddle.

Access the fiddle at: http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/jquery/1.9.1/dmarr/et/tree/master
